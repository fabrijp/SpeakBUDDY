This is a screen that prompts users to subscribe to a plan at the beginning of the app experience. The aim is to get more users to subscribe.

Notes
When implementing, please keep the following points in mind.

● Implement using SwiftUI as much as possible. If it is difficult, you do not have to use SwiftUI.

● The graph on the screen includes animation. Please implement the animation by referring to the attached movie file.

● Please design the classes while paying attention to separation by interest and extensibility.

● Keep the code highly readable, for example by adding comments.

● Please ensure that design quality is not compromised on multiple devices, including

iPad, and the size of each component should be adjusted according to screen size.
